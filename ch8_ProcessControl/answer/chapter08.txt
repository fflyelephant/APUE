8.1 在8-1fork.c中，子进程的结束就是使用的exit()函数，但是父进程照样正常输出，这与我平台中exit()函数的实现有关。正如原文所讲:
	    If the child calls exit, the implementation flushes the standard I/O streams. If this
	is the only action taken by the library, then we will see no difference from the output
	generated if the child called _exit. If the implementation also closes the standard I/O
	streams, however, the memory representing the FILE object for the standard output
	will be cleared out. Because the child is borrowing the parent’s address space, when the
	parent resumes and calls printf, no output will appear and printf will return −1.
	Note that the parent’s STDOUT_FILENO is still valid, as the child gets a copy of the
	parent’s file descriptor array
